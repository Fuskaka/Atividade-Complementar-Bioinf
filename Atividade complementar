O gene EGFR codifica o Receptor do Fator de Crescimento Epidérmico e a variante identificada, que é uma substituição de Leucina (L) por Arginina (R) no códon 858, resulta em um ganho de função na atividade de tirosina quinase. Essa hiperativação causa um aumento na sinalização celular contínua, estimulando a proliferação e sobrevivência celular, e está fortemente associada ao adenocarcinoma de pulmão de não pequenas células (NSCLC). Para o manejo dessa alteração, o tratamento é tipicamente focado no uso de inibidores de tirosina quinase (TKIs), mas há também a opção terapêutica inovadora do Datopotamab Deruxtecan, um anticorpo monoclonal conjugado que entrega um agente citotóxico diretamente ao tumor.\n","\n","A segunda variante, V600E no gene BRAF, é crítica por se situar em um gene fundamental da via de sinalização MAPK/ERK, que controla o crescimento celular. Esta mutação representa a substituição de Valina (V) por Glutamato (E) no códon 600, resultando na ativação constitutiva (permanente) da via MAPK, o que leva à proliferação celular incontrolada. Essa alteração está associada a diversos tipos de câncer, como melanoma, tireoide, colorretal e pulmonar, e seu tratamento é tipicamente realizado através de regimes de terapias-alvo combinadas, como a associação de Dabrafenibe com Trametinibe, ou Encorafenibe com Binimetinibe."],"metadata":{"id":"MBamTo-nbl2t"}}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[],"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyPLfNqCJGJjCyX1o3puVQ0y"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
